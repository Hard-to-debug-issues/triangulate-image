# node-triangulation
triangulate images with node

node version of https://github.com/snorpey/triangulation/

run ``node triangulation.js``.

please note that this project depends on [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) which requires you to [manually install](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#installation) some libraries on your machine.

this project is in the very early stages of development, so there will be bugs. also, the code isn't properly self-contained at the moment, so you'll probably have to copy + paste some stuff from ``triangulation.js``.
